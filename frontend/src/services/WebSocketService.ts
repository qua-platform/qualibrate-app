/**
 * @fileoverview Generic WebSocket client with automatic reconnection and pub/sub pattern.
 *
 * Provides a reusable WebSocket wrapper class for real-time bidirectional communication
 * with automatic reconnection logic and multiple subscriber support.
 *
 * **Primary Use Case**:
 * Used by WebSocketContext.tsx to manage two real-time connections for quantum calibration:
 * - Run status updates: Real-time node/graph execution progress
 * - Execution history: Historical calibration data for timeline visualization
 *
 * **Key Features**:
 * - Type-safe message handling via TypeScript generics
 * - Automatic reconnection with configurable retry attempts (default: 5 retries, 1s delay)
 * - Pub/sub pattern allowing multiple callbacks per WebSocket connection
 * - JSON serialization/deserialization of all messages
 * - Robust connection state tracking with 5-state state machine (ConnectionState enum)
 *
 * **Architecture Pattern**:
 * The service implements a facade pattern over the native WebSocket API, adding
 * resilience features (reconnection) and developer experience improvements (pub/sub,
 * type safety) without requiring changes to consuming code.
 *
 * **RECENT IMPROVEMENTS**:
 * - **State Tracking**: Replaced manual boolean flag with ConnectionState enum for accurate state tracking
 *
 * **REMAINING AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**:
 * 1. **Reconnection Strategy**: Linear backoff (constant delay) instead of exponential
 * 2. **Retry Exhaustion**: After 5 failed attempts, connection permanently fails
 * 3. **Error Handling**: Console-only logging, no user-facing error notifications
 * 4. **Subscriber Errors**: Uncaught errors in subscribers can affect other subscribers
 * 5. **No Runtime Type Validation**: Type safety is compile-time only
 *
 * @see WebSocketContext for React integration and provider implementation
 * @see WS_GET_STATUS and WS_EXECUTION_HISTORY for WebSocket endpoint routes

/**
 * WebSocket connection state machine.
 *
 * **State Transitions**:
 * - DISCONNECTED → CONNECTING: connect() called
 * - CONNECTING → CONNECTED: WebSocket onopen event fires
 * - CONNECTING → FAILED: Connection attempt fails (onclose during CONNECTING)
 * - CONNECTED → FAILED: Unexpected disconnection (onclose during CONNECTED)
 * - FAILED → RECONNECTING: Automatic retry initiated
 * - RECONNECTING → CONNECTING: Retry attempt starts
 * - ANY_STATE → DISCONNECTED: disconnect() called (manual shutdown)
 *
 * **State Meanings**:
 * - DISCONNECTED: Initial state, no connection exists or manually disconnected
 * - CONNECTING: Connection attempt in progress (waiting for onopen)
 * - CONNECTED: Successfully connected and ready to send/receive messages
 * - RECONNECTING: Waiting to retry after connection failure
 * - FAILED: Connection attempt failed, either retrying or exhausted retries

/**
 * Generic WebSocket client with automatic reconnection and pub/sub pattern.
 *
 * **Message Protocol**:
 * - All messages must be JSON-serializable objects
 * - Messages automatically parsed via JSON.parse() on receive
 * - Invalid JSON messages logged as warnings, not thrown as errors
 * - Type safety enforced via generic parameter T (compile-time only, no runtime validation)
 *
 * **Current Usage in QUAlibrate**:
 * Used by WebSocketContext.tsx to manage two real-time connections:
 * 1. Run Status WebSocket (`/execution/ws/run_status`) - node/graph execution updates
 * 2. Execution History WebSocket (`/execution/ws/workflow_execution_history`) - historical data
 *
 * **Connection State Management**:
 * Uses a 5-state state machine (ConnectionState enum) for accurate connection tracking:
 * - DISCONNECTED: Initial state or manually disconnected
 * - CONNECTING: Connection attempt in progress
 * - CONNECTED: Successfully connected and ready
 * - RECONNECTING: Waiting to retry after failure
 * - FAILED: Connection failed (may retry or be exhausted)
 *
 * The isConnected() method provides dual verification by checking both the internal
 * ConnectionState and the actual WebSocket.readyState for maximum reliability.
 *
 * **REMAINING LIMITATIONS**:
 * After retry exhaustion (default 5 attempts), the WebSocket remains permanently
 * disconnected until page refresh. Consider implementing:
 * - Exponential backoff instead of linear backoff for better network resilience
 * - Unlimited reconnection attempts with increasing delays (e.g., cap at 30s)
 * - User-facing "reconnect" button when connection lost
 * - Circuit breaker pattern to avoid overwhelming server during outages
 *
 * **IMPROVEMENT NEEDED: Error Handling**:
 * - Connection errors only log to console (no user feedback mechanism)
 * - No connection timeout handling (browser default timeout varies)
 * - No distinction between recoverable (network issues) vs non-recoverable (bad URL) errors
 *
 * @template T - The message type for this WebSocket connection (must be JSON-serializable)

 * @see WS_GET_STATUS and WS_EXECUTION_HISTORY for WebSocket route constants

   * **Connection Process**:
   * 1. Check if already connected (early return if yes)
   * 2. Create new WebSocket instance with this.url
   * 3. Set isConnected=true on successful open
   * 4. Handle incoming messages by parsing JSON and notifying callbacks
   * 5. On connection close, retry with decremented retry count
   *
   * **Reconnection Behavior**:
   * - Uses LINEAR backoff (same delay between all retry attempts)
   * - Default: 5 retries with 1 second delay = max 5 seconds of retry attempts
   * - After retry exhaustion, connection permanently fails (no further attempts)
   * - Each retry decrements the retries parameter by 1

   *
   * **FRAGILE: Limited Retry Attempts**:
   * After 5 failed attempts, reconnection stops permanently until page refresh.
   * Users lose real-time updates for the rest of their session. Consider:
   * - Unlimited retries with increasing delays (exponential backoff to 30s max)
   * - User-facing "reconnect" button when connection fails
   * - React context state to expose connection status to UI
   *
   * **Error Handling**:
   * - Constructor errors caught and logged (connection attempt failures)

   * - All errors only log to console, no user-facing notifications
   * - No distinction between recoverable vs permanent failures

   * @param delay - Milliseconds between retry attempts (default: 1000)
